# sales-data-analysis-using-pandas
## Background Information:


In this sales data analysis we have used Python Pandas & Python Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc. 

## Business questions:

1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city sold the most product?
3. What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

## Initial steps

### We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
* Removing rows based on a condition
* Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

## Solutions:

### To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

* Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
* Adding columns
* Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
* Using the .apply() method
* Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
* Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
* Labeling our graphs
